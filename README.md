Core Requirements

1. Backend Development (FastAPI + Python)
   Build a RESTful API with the following CRUD operations:

User Management
Simple Registration: Create a user with a username, email, and password (plain text storage)
Simple Login: Basic authentication endpoint
User Profile: Store age, weight, height, fitness goals, medical conditions, activity level
Workout Plans
CRUD operations for workout plans
Fields: plan_name, difficulty_level, duration, target_muscle_groups, exercises_list
Basic pagination (limit/offset)
Exercise
CRUD for individual exercises
Fields: exercise_name, category, equipment_needed, difficulty, instructions, target_muscles etc
Progress Tracking
CRUD for user workout sessions
Fields: user_id, workout_id, date, exercises_completed, sets, reps, weights, duration, calories_burned
Nutrition Logs
CRUD for daily nutrition entries
Fields: user_id, date, meals, calories, macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats)
Chat Interface
POST endpoint for user questions
Integration with the RAG system for contextual responses 2. Database Architecture
SQL/MongoDB Database Storage:
User profiles and authentication data
User-generated data: workout logs, progress tracking, nutrition entries
Structured data: workout plans, user preferences
Relational data: user-workout relationships, user-nutrition relationships
Vector Database Storage:
Knowledge base content: exercise descriptions, nutrition information, fitness methodologies
Static reference material: training principles, recovery protocols, injury prevention guides
Embeddings: for semantic search and similarity matching 3. RAG Implementation
Knowledge Base Content:
Exercise Database: 100+ exercises with detailed descriptions, proper form, and variations
Nutrition Information: Food calories, macronutrients, meal planning guidelines
Fitness Methodologies: Training principles, recovery protocols, injury prevention
RAG System Requirements:
Implement vector embeddings for semantic search (using sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings)
Basic chunking strategy for documents (500-1000 token chunks)
Similarity search with relevance scoring
Context retrieval for user queries
Query Processing:
Accept natural language questions about workouts, nutrition, and fitness
Retrieve relevant context from the vector database
Generate responses using retrieved context + user's data 4. Frontend Implementation
Simple Chat Interface:
Login/Signup forms
Chat interface with message history
Basic user dashboard showing recent activity
Login state management via localStorage/sessionStorage
State Management:
Store user session in localStorage (user_id, username)
No JWT tokens - simple session-based auth 5. Authentication & State Management
Simple Authentication:
Basic username/password login (no encryption required)
Store user session in localStorage/SessionStorage
Simple session validation on protected endpoints
Frontend State:
localStorage: User session, preferences
sessionStorage: Chat history, temporary form data
No complex state management - vanilla JS or simple React state
Technical Specifications
Backend Stack
Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL or MongoDB
Vector Store: ChromaDB / FAISS (local storage) / PineCone
AI/ML: Any embedding model + LLM
Frontend Stack
Basic: Any framework of your choice
No advanced frameworks required
Data Storage Clarification
SQL/MongoDB → Everything user-specific, dynamic, structured (users, workouts, logs).
RAG → Everything domain knowledge, static, unstructured (fitness science, exercise/nutrition details).
Traditional Database (SQL/MongoDB):
Users: id, username, email, password, age, weight, height, goals
Workouts: id, user_id, plan_name, date, exercises, duration
Nutrition: id, user_id, date, meals, calories, macros
Progress: id, user_id, workout_id, sets, reps, weights, notes
Vector Database:
Exercise Knowledge: exercise descriptions, instructions, benefits
Nutrition Knowledge: food information, dietary guidelines, meal plans
Fitness Knowledge: training principles, recovery, injury prevention
API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /auth/register - User registration
POST /auth/login - User login
GET /auth/user/{user_id} - Get user profile
Core CRUD
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /workouts - Workout management
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /exercises - Exercise database
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /nutrition - Nutrition logging
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /progress - Progress tracking
AI Chat
POST /chat/ask - Send question, get RAG-powered response
GET /chat/history/{user_id} - Get chat history
Deliverables
Backend API with all CRUD operations and RAG system
Database with sample data (20+ users and exercises)
Vector database populated with fitness knowledge
Simple chat interface for user interaction
API documentation
README with setup instructions
Simplified Success Criteria
User can register/log in and maintain a session
The user can log workouts and track progress
Chat interface can answer fitness questions using RAG
Data persists between sessions
Prohibited Resources
No AI assistance for coding (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.)
No pre-built fitness applications as templates
No copy-pasting large code blocks from tutorials

Data Sources
You can Download any dataset from Kaggle
Submit the GitHub repository link, make sure it's public
Remember: Focus on functionality over polish. A working system with all core features implemented is better than a partially complete system with perfect UI.
